# Tulin Archive

Welcome!

Here you reach the Tulin Archive repository which aims to preserve and display Tulin's interesting works.

Tulin is a small group of students located in China, and during the three years of junior high, they created abundant works of creativity, humor and care. Being a member of Tulin, I don't want to see it go forever. So, the public repository, as well as a website deployed on Netlify, is set up.

## 0. Content

You can always simply clone the repository and read files one by one. However, for a better experience, you can go to the [Tulin Archive website](https://tulinarchive.netlify.app) and read About section.

As for the works itself, you can either download them from the `data` directory in this repository or refer to the website and follow instructions.

For contact information, in case you are interested in these or you *know* what Tulin is, please also refer to the website.

## 1. Contact

The best way to contact me is to email [talentedbug@tutamail.com](mailto:talentedbug@tutamail.com). However, you can also simply make an issue in the repository.

If you really know what Tulin is and are eager to talk to me, please directly email me and I will give you my personal contact.

## 2. Contribution

This is an archive repository; it's set up to be never maintained. However, if you do have something like errors and website mistake to tell me, you can make an issue and label it as a bug.

> I'm *Talented* Bug, not bug.

## 3. About the Website

Deployed on Netlify, it is designed to be compatible with *any* browser. Seemingly it's a difficult task, but I just use most basic HTML and no CSS. Netlify is a quick CDN in China, where I need to use it most. However, Netlify has a limit of 100 MiB traffic per month, so it can be unavailable for a while. Just wait please!
