    <h1>About Tulin and Tulin Archive</h1>

        Tulin is initially a study group in a junior high in Jiangsu, China. Its 
        goals are to improve students' learning habits, so at that time it was 
        mainly about studying.<br>
        However, as time passed and members' interests changed, it was developed 
        into a comprehensive organization, where we created, shared, laughed, 
        pursued and made progress together. By the time we ended our second year of 
        junior high, we have created tremendous works, which we continued in the third 
        year.<br>
        As it's commonly seen in today's young Chinese, lack of minor feelings appear 
        in Tulin too. But when we were preparing to step out of our classroom, we 
        suddenly felt something. For this, we together agreed that we should save 
        works and share them. So here's the Tulin Archive website.<br>
        From my personal feeling, I really don't want to add an -ed to every verb, 
        but it's true that Tulin is of the past. By creating this website, I wish that 
        many of those who are creative but low in grades could realize there are many 
        of their kind.<br>
        I'd also like to mention the very content of it. The website is handwritten 
        by me, but the Tulin Archive belongs to everyone. For this, we use CC0 license 
        for all its content, so you can share freely.<br>

    <h1>About the Site</h1>
    <p>
        The website itself is created with pure html without frameworks. I avoided 
        any flaws that may cause incompatibility. However, as a result, Tulin 
        Archive turns out to be a plain-text and English site, as these are the most 
        compatible ones.
        The website is online since June 21, 2024.
